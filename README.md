# Kalatas-Document-Management-System-with-Request-and-Tracking

# Project Overview
<h3>The Internet and modern technologies present a wide range of opportunities to
strengthen and enhance the learning environment. Technology has offered more
opportunities for innovation and is being widely utilized to make complex tasks
much easier. It has completely changed how we engage with one another, on how
we learn new things, and access information. When it comes to education it makes
learning more flexible and accessible, allowing more students to access different
kinds of information in a more efficient way of learning. The Sto. Niño Formation
and Science School is now dealing with a manual process in requesting
documents. There are problems encountered such as lack of procedural clarity,
many document requirements, verification authentication for a third party proxy,
and lastly language obstacle knowing that the school is implementing an english
speaking campaign.In order to address those challenges, the researchers will create
and implement a document management system that will allow the office
personnel to classify records, search for retrieve records, and manage document
requests. Moreover, the platform will also allow students to request for documents,
and monitor the status of requests. In addition, the system will help the Sto. Niño
Formation and Science School in preventing the spread of false information by
the use of sending announcements. The system that will be accessible and
available to the students of Sto. Niño Formation and Science School.</h3>

# Sustainable Development Goal
<h3>Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation is the focus of SDG 9</h3>

# What the project does
<h3>A Document Management with Request and Tracking System helps organizations streamline document-related processes, improve collaboration, enhance security, and ensure efficient document lifecycle management. It saves time, reduces paperwork, and provides better control over document access.</h3>

# How to run the project
<h3>When in comes on running the system, first we need to set up the development environment and software to develop and run the application. Next, The administrator or the registrar have to take over the system by logging in to their personal accounts as well as the students. Moreover, the registrar can access their own profile in the system as well as approve requests from students throught the system. They also have the authority to edit, delete, add, create documents according to the request. In the other hand, the students also has the ability to access their personal profile, choose their desired documents that they need for their request, recieve notifications from the registrar regarding for the tracking of their request.</h3>

# Why it's noteworthy 
<h3>In general, providing a document management system for the Sto. Nino Formation and Science School will allow students to request various kinds of documents in a most convenient way. It will also enhance user experience, and will reduce errors and inaccuracies associated with manual request processes being done at this stage.</h3>

# Who mantains the project
<h3>The system will be maintained by the school. For instance, the IT department within the schoool may be responsible for maintaining the compuster systems, networks, and servers.</h3>
